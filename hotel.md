Guest: Good morning, sir.

Operator: Good morning. Are you enjoying your stay at our hotel?

Guest: Yes, I am. The staff is very polite and our room is lovely. My wife and I are having a great time.

Operator: I am happy to hear that. Can I help you with anything this morning?

Guest: Yes, you can. My wife and I want to go out for lunch today. Can you recommend a nice restaurant?

Operator: Of course. What kind of food do you and your wife want to eat?

Guest: My wife is a vegetarian, so we want to eat something with a lot of vegetables.

Operator: Do you eat fish?

Guest: Yes, we eat fish.

Operator: Do you like spicy food?

Guest: My wife likes spicy food, but I do not.

Operator: What about a Japanese restaurant? Their menu includes rice and fish, and they also have many vegetable dishes. There are some spicy dishes and some non-spicy dishes.

Guest: That sounds good.

Operator: There is an excellent Japanese restaurant downtown. I can make a reservation for you now.

Guest: Yes, please. Can you also arrange for a taxi to take us there?

Operator: Sure thing. I will arrange for a taxi to pick you and your wife up at noon. Is that okay?

Guest: That is perfect. Thank you.

Operator: No problem.
